                    Today was an okish day. I woke up and went to play badminton(against my wish) and i played like shit. I only played 2 games and came back home. Then i had some boring online classes, and after that, i finally started working on my webpage. I tried some shit and figured some shit out, and it was fine ig. I coded fr an hour, then i slept for like 3 hours. I woke up at 5:30pm, and then i decided to roam around and figure some routes out. I went till Anna Nagar, til Kora Food St, met Pranav, had ice-cream in Kuchice, and came back home via the VR mall way.Now ik how to get to VR mall, and to Kora Food St. I came back @8:30 and had dinner.

                    Then I continued coding this website, spent an ungodly amount of time trying to make my photo-grid responsive, failed miserably, then saw Yashmeet's story and saw that he was making something cool, felt like a failure, self-depricated, wrote and 'about' for my webpage(which was mostly me shitting on myself, coz afformentioned feelings of failure), decided to do something abt my self esteem, and looked through my photos and chose 30 fun/good photos of mine to create a photo-gallery, and i spent more time than needed cropping, arranging, and rearranging the photo-grid. But in the end, I liked how it turned out ngl.

                    Then, combined with watching some yt, trying out netlify and failing, figuring out github pages and how github works with its annoying UI, i finally uploaded my web-page to the internet :D Then, i played some chess, and got back to coding. And now, I'm wrtiting this blog. I didn't learn much as such today, just a lil bit abt how github works, and this one code to make the scrolling smooth, which is : html{scrolling-behaviour:smooth;} and that's it ig? Most of today was practice and making my own cool-looking website, and ngl, it does look super cool. Now, I've got some finishing up to do, which is adding some content to the last page- Current Month Goals. Anyways, Its 3:15AM rn, and I'm currently in tomorrow, so I'm gonna write what i wanna achieve today/tomorrow/whatever uk what i mean.
